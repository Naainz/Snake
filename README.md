# Snake Game Variations

Welcome to the **Snake Game Variations** repository! Here, you can play the classic game of Snake in various quirky and unconventional formats. Whether you're a fan of JavaScript, Python, or just enjoy humorous twists on classic games, there's something here for you.

## Features

### 1. Play with the JavaScript Console
Enjoy the classic Snake game directly from your browser's JavaScript console. This version offers a minimalist approach where you can control the snake using your keyboard within the console. Perfect for developers who want to sneak in a quick game during debugging!

### 2. Play from the Python Terminal
For Python enthusiasts, this variation allows you to play Snake directly from your Python terminal. No need for a graphical interface; just pure, text-based Python fun.

### 3. Bouncing Snake Window
A fun take on the old DVD player screensaver, this version of Snake has the game window itself bouncing around your screen. You'll need to stay focused as the game window moves around, adding an extra challenge to the classic gameplay.

### 4. Snake with Ads
Experience Snake like never before—with ads! This version includes fake ads that mimic the experience of modern-day internet browsing, complete with unskippable and skippable ads. Don't worry, no real promotions here, just some added fun.

### 5. Snake with Stock Prices
